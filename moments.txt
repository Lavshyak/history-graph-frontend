regraph: webgl, problems with react components in node render.

react-vis-network-graph: possible to render react components in nodes, but it is not convenient and may be performance issues.

react-d3-graph: MTI, old react.
npm install d3@^5.5.0      # if you don't have d3 already
npm install react@^16.4.1  # if you don't have react already
npm install react-d3-graph

visx - ok, but doesn't provide layout.
